## What is My Garage?

**My Garage** is a modern application that allows you to keep track of your garage inventory. Whether itâ€™s tools, car parts, or other items, My Garage helps you organize and manage everything in one place efficiently.

## Requirements

- Node.js (latest stable version recommended)
- MySQL (make sure it is installed and running)

## Installation

1. Install Node.js by downloading it from https://nodejs.org/.
2. Extract or clone the project into your desired folder.
3. Open a terminal in the project root and install dependencies:
   npm install
4. Create a `.env` file in the project root if it does not exist, with the following content:
   PORT=3000
   ALLOW_REGISTRATION=true
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_NAME=mygarage
   DB_USER=mygarage_user
   DB_PASSWORD=jaka_sifra_123
5. Set up MySQL database and user. Open MySQL CLI or your preferred GUI and run:
   CREATE DATABASE howtosay;
   CREATE USER 'mygarage_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'jaka_sifra_123';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON howtosay.* TO 'mygarage_user'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
6. Start the server:
   npm run start

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Enjoy managing your garage! ðŸš—ðŸ”§
